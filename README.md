Using a dataset provided by the University of California, Irvine, data from experiments involving a group
of 30 volunteers was reshaped to provide the average and standard deviation of measurements for each 
combination of subject and activity (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, etc.).

For each record is provided:

-The Subject Number
-The group the subject was in (test or trial)
-The activity performed
-The average triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer
-The standard deviation of the triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer.


The following files have been included:

- 'README.md'
- 'CodeBook.md' : a file describing all the variables in the data set
- 'humanactivity.txt' : a file containing all the variables described above
